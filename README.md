Customer Term Deposit Subscription Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to determine whether a banking customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit plan. By accurately predicting customer behavior, this model can help optimize marketing strategies for telecallers, allowing them to target individuals with a higher propensity to subscribe, thereby increasing conversion rates and efficiency.

The application features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with PyQt5, allowing users to input various customer attributes and receive an instant prediction.

Features
Customer Data Input: A user-friendly GUI to input various customer demographic and behavioral data points.

SVM Prediction Model: Utilizes a pre-trained Support Vector Machine model to predict subscription likelihood.

Real-time Results: Displays the prediction (subscribed/not subscribed) directly in the GUI.

Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for handling categorical variables and preparing data for the SVM model.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

PyQt5: Used for building the desktop graphical user interface.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing the Support Vector Machine algorithm and data preprocessing (e.g., LabelEncoder).

Installation and Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Archana-NJ/customer-term-deposit-prediction-svm.git
cd customer-term-deposit-prediction-svm



Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate



Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn PyQt5



Ensure you have the dataset:
The project expects a train.csv file. Based on the provided Python code, it looks for it at a specific path. You will need to place your train.csv dataset in a location accessible by your SVM.py script, or update the path variable in the svm function within SVM.py to point to your dataset's location.

Example of updating the path in SVM.py if train.csv is in the same directory as SVM.py:

# In SVM.py, inside the svm(self) function:
# path="C:/Users/Admin/Downloads/2025_projects/2024_projects/19_SubscriberPrediction/train.csv"
path="train.csv" # Change this line



Usage
Run the application:

python SVM.py



Input Data: The GUI will open. Enter the relevant customer information into the respective input fields (Age, Job, Marital, Education, Default, Balance, Housing, Loan, Contact, Day, Month, Duration, Campaign, Pdays, Previous, Poutcome).

Get Prediction: Click the "PREDICT SUBSCRIPTION" button. The "RESULTS:" field will display the prediction (e.g., prediction:[0] for 'no subscription' or prediction:[1] for 'subscription').

Dataset Information
The model is trained on a dataset containing various attributes of banking customers, including:

Demographic Information: age, job, marital, education

Financial Information: default, balance, housing, loan

Contact & Campaign Information: contact, day, month, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome

Target Variable: y_bool (indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit, likely 0 for no and 1 for yes after encoding).

Model Details
The core of the prediction is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The SVM algorithm is used to find an optimal hyperplane that best separates the two classes (subscribed vs. not subscribed) in a high-dimensional feature space. Categorical features are converted to numerical representations using LabelEncoder before training the model.
